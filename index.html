    <h1>What is this project?</h1>
    <p>To introduce the writing I’ve done for this project, I will say that video games are a hobby of mine, with Nintendo as my favorite game company. I enjoy playing games as well as writing about them. My love of video games and preference for centering essays and projects on the things I care about is what led me to the &lt;canvas&gt; element for this project. I also consider myself to be above an average skill level when playing the games I play regularly, and I enjoy looking into and understanding the underlying mechanics of a game and how they create a unique experience.
<br><br>For all this time I spend playing games, I had never done much thinking about the subject from the perspective of the game developer, the ones who conceptualize and create these games that I love so much. If I ever thought about the methods and practices a game developer would follow to create a game, I only considered the concepts and ideas that affected the user’s experience with the game. I thought of vague ideals that the developers writes line after line of code to achieve, such as “never leave the player stuck in a level with no way to escape” or “use collectable items to guide the player.” My familiarity with usability and user-centered design through my major in Technical Writing certainly reinforced this line of thinking.
<br><br>What I had never really considered until embarking on this project is that in the realm of game development, especially within the growing scene of game development within &lt;canvas&gt;, far more discussion takes place on how to write that code in the first place. Pursuing an ideal game design, it seems, doesn’t work very well if you can’t design a game in the first place. Techniques for optimizing written code and the proper ways to implement common game elements like gravity and collision detection make up the bulk of my findings on &lt;canvas&gt; game development discussion. Game developers working in &lt;canvas&gt; discuss the ways they can get these older, accepted elements of game design into this new environment.
<br><br>Using Christina Haas’s extension of Vygotsky’s historical-genetic method onto technology as a framework to examine &lt;canvas&gt; and game design, the difference in my prior views on gaming and what I found as I delved into the development scene have a clear explanation. Vygotsky’s method argued that in order to understand an artifact, you had to study the context surrounding the artifact and the history that led up to it. Haas builds off this concept and applies it to understanding technology and literacy in the 20th century by arguing that understanding literacy requires understanding the technologies that support it in the past, present and future as well as how its media are similar to and different from the media that came before.
<br><br>More importantly for my work here, Haas makes the assertion that a technology’s uses are closely tied to the other things we humans do, and our views of a technology are shaped by how we use it. A person’s knowledge of and needs from a technology form a context that informs how that person engages with it. This was critical for my understanding of video games, &lt;canvas&gt; and the discourse around them that I researched for this project. I primarily play games, so I think of practices that affect the player’s experience. A game developer primarily creates games, so he or she would think of practices that affect the creator’s experience. This can be extrapolated to how different groups use &lt;canvas&gt; as well; a video game developer’s uses &lt;canvas&gt; for different kinds of work compared to a web developer, so each group’s views about what aspects of the element are important differ as well.</p>

    <h1 id="b">Overview: What is the &lt;canvas&gt; element?</h1>
        <p>The &lt;canvas&gt; element creates a rectangle space on a web page for a developer to manipulate JavaScript to draw graphs and animations as well as handle photo compositions and video processing. The element itself is easy to form in an HTML document. The only code needed to build a canvas is a call for the element and settings for the width and height. Once formed, a developer calls the canvas from the Document Object Model (DOM). This creates the canvas's drawing context, where the drawing methods and properties used for the canvas itself are defined. Now, JavaScript code and even CSS properties like fileStyle can manipulate the canvas.
        <br><br>The &lt;canvas&gt; element actually can be used to create video games to be played in a web browser. JavaScript code is used to build the game elements, such as a player character, an image background and game rules such as win conditions and collision detection, which display to the player through the canvas. As one could imagine, browser games built in &lt;canvas&gt; are quite the different experience compared to more traditional video games played on a PC or a dedicated game console. &lt;canvas&gt;-based browser games are normally the domain of smaller, independent “indie” publishers in today’s video game scene.

    <h1 id="c">History and Significance of &lt;canvas&gt;</h1>
      <p>The story of &lt;canvas&gt;'s development begins in 2004, with Apple developing the tag for use with their own Safari browser and OSX WebKit component to operate Dashboard items. According to WHATWG specification writer Ian Hickson, Apple developed and introduced &lt;canvas&gt; to the Web without going through any sort of standardization first (not even unofficial standardization like the WHATWG)...", though WHATWG eventually did standardize the element. By bringing in JavaScript, &lt;canvas&gt; greatly expanded what kinds of graphics web developers could use for their pages. Yet, even before &lt;canvas&gt;, web developers have already been building graphics features into websites. Web developers at Apple built this element as a way to streamline and facilitate this work already being done.<br><br>
As relatively new as &lt;canvas&gt; is among web technologies, using it for game development is an even newer idea still. Game developers who would use &lt;canvas&gt; to do their work have only recently joined in the conversation about the element’s development, and because of this they don’t have much power in how &lt;canvas&gt; will continue to develop. Discussions saved on the W3C mailing-lists support this observation, with features that function fine for web development and other web work being preferred by the well-established web developers, even if those features interfere with video game functionality.<br><br>
Yet, therein lies the great thing about &lt;canvas&gt;; game developers and gamers are now a part of the web development scene. Thanks to the capabilities of &lt;canvas&gt;, a group that was external to web development in the past has now been invited to join in, to have an influence on its present form and a stake in its future. In addition, game developers bring new ideals and practices on how web development work should be done, which will take &lt;canvas&gt;’s development in a new direction, perhaps different from its original intent, yet just as important and valuable for the element’s history and context.<br><br>
The scenario surrounding &lt;canvas&gt; serves as a demonstration of a larger phenomenon; HTML as a whole has changed based on the people and groups that have entered the web development scene, who have brought their own ideas of how it should be into the discussion and have done the work to implement them.</p>

    <h1 id="d">Trends & Practices</h1>
    <p>As a part of this project, I conducted research on sources on web browser and &lt;canvas&gt;-based video games to determine what some best practices were for three key aspects of games: the visuals, player movement (specifically jumping) and enemy behavior. I decided to focus on game practices within the context of games in the platformer genre.</p>

This knowledge on using tools isn’t naturally formed, no “one right way” to do it
It all depends on who enters the scene and does the work
Reminder that HTML / HyperText was developed in a very different context
Canvas bridges that gap from then to now
What ways were developers able to use to bring in gaming practices?
I want to recreate this interaction in a game, how do the tools I have with the web / canvas recreate that interaction?
