    <h1>Overview</h1>
        <p>The <'canvas'> element creates a rectangle space on a web page for a developer to manipulate JavaScript to draw graphs and animations as well as handle photo compositions and video processing. The element itself is easy to form in an HTML document. The only code needed to build a canvas is a call for the element and settings for the width and height. Once formed, a developer calls the canvas from the Document Object Model (DOM). This creates the canvas's drawing context, where the drawing methods and properties used for the canvas itself are defined. Now, JavaScript code and even CSS properties like fileStyle can manipulate the canvas.</p>

    <h1>Abstract</h1>
      <p>The story of <'canvas'>'s development begins in 2004, with Apple developing the tag for use with their own Safari browser and OSX WebKit component to operate Dashboard items. According to WHATWG specification writer Ian Hickson, Apple developed and introduced <'canvas'> to the Web without going through any sort of standardization first (not even unofficial standardization like the WHATWG)...", though WHATWG eventually did standardize the element. By bringing in JavaScript, <'canvas'> greatly expanded what kinds of graphics web developers could use for their pages. Yet, even before <’canvas’>, web developers have already been building graphics features into websites. Web developers at Apple built this element as a way to streamline and facilitate this work already being done.<br><br>
The <'canvas'> element actually can be used to create video games to be played in a web browser. JavaScript code is used to build the game elements, such as a player character, an image background and game rules such as win conditions and collision detection, which display to the player through the canvas. As one could imagine, browser games built in <'canvas'> are quite the different experience compared to more traditional video games played on a PC or a dedicated game console. <’canvas’>-based browser games are normally the domain of smaller, independent “indie” publishers in today’s video game scene.<br><br>
As relatively new as <’canvas’> is among web technologies, using it for game development is an even newer idea still. Game developers who would use <’canvas’> to do their work have only recently joined in the conversation about the element’s development, and because of this they don’t have much power in how <’canvas’> will continue to develop. Discussions saved on the W3C mailing-lists support this observation, with features that function fine for web development and other web work being preferred by the well-established web developers, even if those features interfere with video game functionality.<br><br>
Yet, therein lies the great thing about <’canvas’>; game developers and gamers are now a part of the web development scene. Thanks to the capabilities of <’canvas’>, a group that was external to web development in the past has now been invited to join in, to have an influence on its present form and a stake in its future. In addition, game developers bring new ideals and practices on how web development work should be done, which will take <’canvas’>’s development in a new direction, perhaps different from its original intent, yet just as important and valuable for the element’s history and context.<br><br>
The scenario surrounding <’canvas’> serves as a demonstration of a larger phenomenon; HTML as a whole has changed based on the people and groups that have entered the web development scene, who have brought their own ideas of how it should be into the discussion and have done the work to implement them.</p>
